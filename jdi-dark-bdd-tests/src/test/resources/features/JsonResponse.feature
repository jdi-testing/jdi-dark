  Scenario: Check json response
    Given I init service
    And I set JSON request content type
    When I do getMethod request
    Then Response status type is OK
    And Response body has values
      | url          | http://httpbin.org/get |
      | headers.Host | httpbin.org            |
    And Response header "Connection" is "keep-alive"
